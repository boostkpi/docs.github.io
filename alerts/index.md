## Support for rolling-7-day alerts

Our blog post at [Sample alerting configurations](https://blog.boostkpi.com/Sample-alerting-configurations/) shows an example of a rolling 7-day alert for a daily dataset.

## Alerts based on target

```
Q: Do you support alerts based on targets? For example, 
if I have monthly (campaign) spend targets by country, 
can BoostKPI alert me when my daily spend is outside 20% 
of the spend required to hit my monthly target?
```

Yes, few of our customers use this feature in production. Please contact us for details.

## Alerts routing to specific email address
```
Q: I want some alerts being routed to one group email address 
and other alerts being routed to another group email. Is that possible?
```

Yes, you can do so by creating two subscription groups. Please ask your BoostKPI account manager.
