## Blank page
```
Q: I see a blank page when I go to BoostKPI. How do I fix it?

It seems your credentials have expired. Please do a force logout by navigating to

## Inconsistent data
```
Q: I see inconsistent data on the page. Is there a way to do a 'hard refresh'?
```
Yes, you can clear cached data in your browser by clicking on the user icon (on the upper right-hand corner) > settings > 'Trigger cleanup'. After you reload, you should not see any inconsistent data.
