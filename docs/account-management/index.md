### Invite users

You can invite users by clicking on settings > invite users.

Once you click on invite users, type in the email address one-at-a-time, and click invite. The users
should receive an email invitation. You can only invite users who share the same domain as you. If
your email address is x@foo.com, you can invite any email user with a foo.com domain.
