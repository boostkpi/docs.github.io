### Key features

The application has 5 key areas:
##### Dashboard
Use this tab to customize and access your "dashboard-views", investigate the root cause of any change in KPIs compared to any baseline, and save any investigations as "snapshots". “Snapshots” can be shared amongst team members.
##### ADA
Use this tab to interact with ADA, our AI Data Analyst. Choose your workspace to access your [own personalized AI analyst](https://blog.boostkpi.com/ai-data-analyst/).  
##### Alerts
Use this tab to set up granular alerts that combine unsupervised learning with business rules. The anomalies resulting from these alerts can be routed intelligently based on both the root cause as well as the magnitude of the deviation. The alerts can also be sent via slack.
##### Anomalies 
Use this tab to view anomalies that resulted from any of your configured alerts. These anomalies, besides being routed to users or to slack/teams, can also be viewed on the dashboard.
##### Connect
