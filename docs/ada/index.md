## Overview

With ADA, you have a personal AI that analyzes data just like a human analyst
would. You can ask ADA any question using plain language—from general overviews
to detailed inquiries. ADA is smart enough to understand the context of your
questions, and if something isn't clear, it will ask for clarification to
provide the most accurate and relevant answers.

Here’s what makes ADA special:

- **Intelligent Workspaces:** Create tailored data environments with custom
  tables, views, and queries designed for different user needs. It’s like
having a senior analyst prepare everything for a junior to understand easily.

- **Context-Rich Orchestration:** ADA smoothly transitions between generating
  SQL queries and performing in-depth analyses, all explained in
easy-to-understand language. [Learn more about our orchestration approach

- **Personalized AI Analysis:** ADA adapts to your specific role, learning from
  your context and past questions to deliver insights that are especially
relevant to you.

- **Scalable Insights:** Easily extend advanced data analysis across your
  organization. ADA works around the clock, offering cost-effective support
without overloading your data teams.

- **Continuous Learning:** With every interaction, ADA gets smarter, offering
  you increasingly precise and actionable insights over time.

ADA leverages advanced Large Language Models (LLMs), an orchestration approach,
and dynamic workspaces to bring you these features. [Learn more about ADA.](https://blog.boostkpi.com/ai-data-analyst/)

## Workspaces
**Setting Up Your Workspace**
We recommend setting up a separate workspace for each of your use cases. It's
also beneficial to create distinct workspaces for different teams and
functional roles within your organization. When configuring a workspace, you
can include the relevant warehouse tables, BoostKPI datasets, and any other
custom instructions you need.

**Key Features:**
- **SQL Syntax Recognition:** ADA automatically understands and interacts with the SQL language used by your data warehouse.
- **Metadata Utilization:** If your warehouse tables include metadata, like column descriptions, ADA seamlessly incorporates this information for more accurate responses.
- **Custom Instructions:** You can add any specific details to guide ADA. For example, explain what a column name represents (e.g., **oid** means order number), define possible values for a column (e.g., **cleared_customs** can be **YES** or **NO**), specify character case rules (e.g., values are always lowercase), describe derived KPIs (e.g., **AOV** is the ratio of total revenue to total orders), and clarify terms (e.g., **FY2022** runs from April 1, 2022, to March 31, 2023).

## Conversation History
On the left panel, you'll find your conversation history neatly organized by
workspace. Click on any conversation to review past interactions. In the near
future, you'll also have the ability to rate ADA's responses, which helps it to
continuously learn and improve.

Additionally, you can conveniently **share**, **rename**, or **delete**
conversations by clicking the respective options.
